<p>A quick post to the site to let people know I am alive for the week of 9/21/2020 to 9/27.<br>
I hope to get an article out sometime in October on my current project involving oAuth1 &amp;oAuth2. Since Iâ€™ve gotten accepted into GA Tech Iâ€™ve been brushing up on my math and C / C++.</p>
<h3 id="working-on">Working on</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linear algebra. Currently neck deep in Hefferonâ€™s excellent and free <em><a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/">Linear Algebra</a></em></li>
<li>Lots of low-level C programming. Never realized how much higher-level languages took care of string manipulation for you. <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Hacker rank</a> has been an excellent tool for practice. Besides that, I have been giving <a href="https://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a> a try.</li>
<li>Built a CLI hangman game in C with 1000+ word bank.</li>
<li>Finished <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix">Unix Workbench</a> course on Coursera. Focused on command line stuff and Bash.</li>
<li>Android phone screen gave out on me (from flicker to dead). Have switched to iPhone.</li>
<li>On that note Iâ€™ve had to change my time management application from my android based app to a Linux based CLI <a href="https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson">Watson</a>. Has been pretty clean so far.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goals-for-the-upcoming-week">Goals for the upcoming week</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trying to limit my caffeine to a healthy amount from the copious amounts I have been drinking. I am doing 1 cup a day.</li>
<li>Aiming to get 8+ hours a day studying. Switching between C/ C++</li>
<li>Still working on using only VIM or VIM style interfaces.</li>
<li>Checkpoint my Linear algebra to prepare for the first midterm.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="etc.">etc.</h3>
<p>Excited about my special someone. Trying to get them a gift that wonâ€™t suck. Have been using a vertical second monitor at my dock. Been getting some power issues.<br>
Not enjoying iOS, but itâ€™s workable.</p>
<p>â€“ till next time. ðŸ˜Š</p>
