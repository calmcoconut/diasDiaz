### Takeaways
* Human computer interaction (HCI) is a course offered by GA Tech’s OMSCS
* Taking the course will equip you with design principles and techniques established in the field of HCI

## What is HCI?
The past decade has revealed a trend of embedding microprocessors in non-traditional applications. For example, a CPU in a refrigerator would be unheard of only a decade ago. The growing ubiquity of processing power has fueled the growth of the field of Human-computer interaction.

The course is valuable in exposing students to HCI and teaching them to adopt the principles and methods developed over the last century. The curriculum presents traditional computer interfaces (e.g., computers and smartphones) and non-traditional interfaces, such as human-computer interaction in education, VR, augmented reality, and wearables. 

The course moves on to teach how humans interact with computers and some common design pitfalls. If the class had a theme, perhaps it would be, "Designers should not design for designers, designers should design for the users." and, "You are NOT your user." The course stresses involving users to generate feedback in each step of the design process. It presents a methodology for the application of user-centered design both in research and in industry.

## What did I learn in HCI?
#### **The design lifecycle**
The course emphasizes that the user should be involved in each step of the design lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of a non-linear model:
1.	needfinding, 
2.	design alternatives, 
3.	prototyping, 
4.	evaluation

Each phase involves the user either directly or given by incorporating previous user feedback. For example, needfinding is done by identifying a user type, recruiting participants of that user type, then gathering data via interview, survey, think-aloud, etc.

#### **You are not your user and other principles of HCI**
Principles of design are taught in the course, with the caveat that they cannot replace a user-centered approach. Nonetheless, the principles prove useful both for analyzing and coming up with interfaces. The principles discussed are those established by giants in the field such as Don Norman's discussion of discoverability (i.e., an interface should allow users to discover how to use it without fear of error) and the Feedback Gulfs.
#### **User-centered design and Agile development**
This portion of the course focused on adapting the user-centered design model to modern, quick-turnaround industries by adapting the lifecycle to Agile sprints. The literature in HCI backs this up with authors like Stephanie Chamberlain, Helen Sharp, and Neil Maiden making a case for an Agile, User-centered design chimera. The result is a user-centered product with a "caffeinated" design lifecycle that can thrive in time-sensitive projects familiar to the software industry.

## What type of work to expect from HCI (6750)?
- Plenty of writing assignments
    - "M" assignments propagating students through the design lifecycle
    - Final project involves solo investigation using the design lifecycle model (20-page paper)
- Exploration of the literature in the field
- Designing and executing needfinding, prototyping, and evaluation

## Why take this course?
* You’re intrested in solid design principles from an academic perspective
* You realize and embrace that software is an interdisciplinary field
* You want a “soft” entrance to your master’s program focused on writing and not programming. Great to develop soft skills like communication
