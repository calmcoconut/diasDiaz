An update from the last time we spoke. I want to get some in depth articles up, but I've only been putting time into mathematics in preparation for more theory based courses I am expecting this upcoming semester.

## Working on
* Linear algebra is still taking up most of my day. Hefferon's [Linear Algebra]("http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/) is still serving me well. What's more is I discovered his recently uploaded lectures that follow the textbook. [A blessing of the lockdown](https://www.youtube.com/c/JimHefferon/playlists) 
 * Switched my efforts from C to C++ just because of the STD. The syntax is a little boggling compared to Java. I am Using:
    * Udacity's free [C++ for Programmers](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-for-programmers--ud210)
    * Bjarne's excellent book Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
    * Hackerrank + Exercism.io
* Speaking of exercism.io, I've started mentoring on their Java track.
* Started diving into Al Doer and Ken Levasseur's Applied Discrete Structures but Dropped it in favor of Lehman's Mathematics for Computer Science along side MIT Opencourseware's [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm)
* Bought a Ducky One mini with Silent Cherry Red's to replace my blue's. (basically was too loud at sensitive times. I wanted too keep typing at 5am without waking my SO).
* Alongside that last point, I am converting to touch typing currently hitting around 30 WPM which is terrible, but I will keep it up and see how it does. If you're interested I am using:
    * [Typing Club](www.typingclub.com)
    * [keybr](www.keybr.com)

## Goals for the Upcoming Week
 * Aiming to finish Hefferon's textbook early the middle November.
 * Hit 80-90 WPM using touch typing.
 * A medium sized C++ program on my git.
 * finish exercism's C++ course.

 ## Reflections Since last Post
 I was able to limit my caffeine and have been regularly hitting the 6-8 hour range studying. I did it by keeping a strict schedule, up by 4:30AM and in the Linear algebra a cup of coffee later (around 5am).
 Let's figure out on avoiding burn out now. Naps have really helped.

-Well, till next time space cowboy
